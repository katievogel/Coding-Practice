# Coding-Practice
A jumble of coding practice problems I work on and add to. It's admittedly a little messy but it's more like a 'scratch pad' of practicing various coding problems along the way, not formal project code. I use it for learning and figuring out new things, and mastering others. Learning never ends in the code world so why not share some of my practice tidbits.
